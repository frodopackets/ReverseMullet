# Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro Cost Analysis Estimate Report

## Service Overview

Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro is a fully managed, serverless service that allows you to This project uses multiple AWS services.. This service follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, making it cost-effective for various workloads.

## Pricing Model

This cost analysis estimate is based on the following pricing model:
- **ON DEMAND** pricing (pay-as-you-go) unless otherwise specified
- Standard service configurations without reserved capacity or savings plans
- No caching or optimization techniques applied

## Assumptions

- 10 prompts per day for 30 days (300 total prompts per month)
- Average prompt length: 100 tokens input
- Average response length: 200 tokens output
- No Knowledge Base usage (direct model inference only)
- Standard ON DEMAND pricing model
- US East (N. Virginia) region
- No prompt caching utilized

## Limitations and Exclusions

- Knowledge Base costs (not applicable for direct model usage)
- Data transfer costs
- Provisioned throughput costs
- Custom model training costs
- AWS Lambda or other compute costs for your frontend

## Cost Breakdown

### Unit Pricing Details

| Service | Resource Type | Unit | Price | Free Tier |
|---------|--------------|------|-------|------------|
| Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro | Input Tokens | 1,000 tokens | $0.0008 | No free tier available for Bedrock foundation models |
| Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro | Output Tokens | 1,000 tokens | $0.0032 | No free tier available for Bedrock foundation models |

### Cost Calculation

| Service | Usage | Calculation | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro | 300 prompts per month with 100 input tokens and 200 output tokens each (Input Tokens: 30,000 tokens (300 prompts × 100 tokens), Output Tokens: 60,000 tokens (300 prompts × 200 tokens)) | Input: $0.0008/1K × 30K tokens = $0.024 + Output: $0.0032/1K × 60K tokens = $0.192 = $0.216 total. Note: There appear to be different pricing tiers - using the higher rate of $0.0008 input/$0.0032 output for standard usage. | $0.78 |
| **Total** | **All services** | **Sum of all calculations** | **$0.78/month** |

### Free Tier

Free tier information by service:
- **Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro**: No free tier available for Bedrock foundation models

## Cost Scaling with Usage

The following table illustrates how cost estimates scale with different usage levels:

| Service | Low Usage | Medium Usage | High Usage |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro | $0/month | $0/month | $1/month |

### Key Cost Factors

- **Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro**: 300 prompts per month with 100 input tokens and 200 output tokens each

## Projected Costs Over Time

The following projections show estimated monthly costs over a 12-month period based on different growth patterns:

Base monthly cost calculation:

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro | $0.78 |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | **$0** |

| Growth Pattern | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Steady | $0/mo | $0/mo | $0/mo | $0/mo |
| Moderate | $0/mo | $0/mo | $0/mo | $1/mo |
| Rapid | $0/mo | $0/mo | $1/mo | $2/mo |

* Steady: No monthly growth (1.0x)
* Moderate: 5% monthly growth (1.05x)
* Rapid: 10% monthly growth (1.1x)

### Exclusions

- Knowledge Base costs (not applicable for direct model usage)
- Data transfer costs
- Provisioned throughput costs
- Custom model training costs
- AWS Lambda or other compute costs for your frontend

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions

- Monitor your actual token usage as it may vary significantly from estimates
- Consider implementing prompt optimization to reduce token consumption
- Track usage patterns to identify if provisioned throughput might be more cost-effective for consistent usage
#### Best Practices

- Use prompt caching for repeated context to reduce costs (cache reads are $0.0002 per 1K tokens)
- Optimize prompt engineering to get better results with fewer tokens
- Consider Nova Lite ($0.0002 input/$0.0008 output) for simpler tasks to reduce costs
- Monitor AWS Cost Explorer for actual usage patterns and costs
