# ‚úÖ Simple AWS Amplify Deployment (Fixed)

The CLI script failed because it's trying to set up a full backend. For static hosting, use the AWS Console instead.

## üöÄ **Correct Deployment Method**

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Amplify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy via AWS Console (5 minutes)

1. **Go to AWS Amplify Console**
   - Visit: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
   - Sign in to your AWS account

2. **Start New App**
   - Click **"Create new app"**
   - Choose **"Host web app"**

3. **Connect Repository**
   - Select **"GitHub"** as source
   - Click **"Continue"**
   - Authorize AWS Amplify (if prompted)
   - Choose repository: **"ReverseMullet"**
   - Choose branch: **"main"**
   - Click **"Next"**

4. **Configure Build**
   - App name: `bedrock-chat-ui`
   - Build settings should auto-detect your `amplify.yml`
   - Should show:
     ```yaml
     version: 1
     frontend:
       phases:
         preBuild:
           commands:
             - npm ci
         build:
           commands:
             - npm run build
       artifacts:
         baseDirectory: out
         files:
           - '**/*'
     ```
   - Click **"Next"**

5. **Review and Deploy**
   - Review settings
   - Click **"Save and deploy"**
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete

### Step 3: Access Your Live App
After deployment, you'll get URLs like:
- **Main UI**: `https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com/`
- **Terminal**: `https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com/terminal/`
- **Bubblegum**: `https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com/bubblegum/`

## üéØ **Why This Method Works Better**

- ‚úÖ **No CLI setup needed** - just use the web console
- ‚úÖ **No AWS credentials required** - uses your browser login
- ‚úÖ **Static hosting only** - no backend complexity
- ‚úÖ **Auto-detects configuration** - uses your amplify.yml
- ‚úÖ **Automatic deployments** - rebuilds on git push

## üîç **What Went Wrong with CLI**

The CLI script failed because:
- `amplify init` tries to create a full backend project
- It needs AWS credentials configured locally
- It's designed for full-stack apps, not static sites
- The console method is much simpler for static hosting

## üì± **Alternative: GitHub Actions (Optional)**

If you want automated deployments, I can set up GitHub Actions instead of Amplify CLI.
