### Understanding Pricing Confidence Levels

#### **üü¢ High Confidence (Real-Time Data)**
- Uses live AWS pricing data via MCP server
- Accurate to current AWS rates
- Recommended for production planning

#### **üü° Medium Confidence (Knowledge Base)**
- Uses AI knowledge when MCP unavailable
- Should be verified with AWS Calculator
- Good for initial estimates

#### **üî¥ Low Confidence (Limited Information)**
- Insufficient details provided
- Requires more specific information
- Ask follow-up questions for better accuracy

## üîß Advanced Features

### Multi-Service Architecture Analysis

The agent can analyze complex architectures:

```
"I'm building a microservices platform with:
- 5 EC2 instances (t3.medium) for application servers
- Application Load Balancer
- RDS MySQL cluster (db.r5.large) with read replicas
- ElastiCache Redis cluster
- S3 for file storage and backups
- CloudFront CDN
- Route 53 for DNS
Expected traffic: 100,000 requests/day"
```

### Regional Cost Optimization

Compare costs across regions:

```
"Compare total costs for my architecture across:
- us-east-1 (primary)
- us-west-2 (disaster recovery)
- eu-west-1 (European users)
Include data transfer costs between regions"
```

### Scenario Planning

Analyze different scenarios:

```
"Compare costs for three scenarios:
1. Development environment (minimal resources)
2. Staging environment (production-like)
3. Production environment (high availability)"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **"MCP Server Unavailable" Message**
- **Cause**: AWS Labs MCP server temporarily unavailable
- **Solution**: The agent falls back to knowledge base
- **Action**: Verify results with AWS Calculator for production planning

#### **"Need More Details" Response**
- **Cause**: Query too vague for accurate pricing
- **Solution**: Provide more specific information about:
  - Instance types and sizes
  - Storage requirements
  - Expected usage patterns
  - Performance requirements

#### **Unexpected Cost Estimates**
- **Cause**: Different assumptions than expected
- **Solution**: Check the "Assumptions" section in the response
- **Action**: Clarify your requirements and ask again

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Try Rephrasing**: Use different words to describe your needs
2. **Be More Specific**: Add details about your requirements
3. **Check Assumptions**: Review the assumptions in the response
4. **Ask Follow-up Questions**: The agent maintains conversation context

2. **Reserved Instances**: Commit to 1-3 years for predictable workloads
3. **Spot Instances**: Use for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads
4. **Storage Optimization**: Use appropriate storage classes (IA, Glacier)
5. **Regional Selection**: Choose regions based on cost vs. latency needs

### Cost Monitoring

The agent can help you understand:
- **Cost Trends**: How costs change with scale
- **Break-Even Points**: When Reserved Instances become cost-effective
- **Scaling Costs**: How costs increase with usage
- **Optimization ROI**: Return on investment for optimization efforts

### Planning Considerations

- **Growth Planning**: Factor in expected growth when choosing solutions
- **Disaster Recovery**: Include DR costs in total cost of ownership
- **Compliance**: Some regions/services cost more but may be required
- **Performance vs. Cost**: Balance performance requirements with budget
