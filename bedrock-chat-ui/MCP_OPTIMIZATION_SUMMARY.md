## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### System Prompt Enhancements

The system prompt was enhanced with:

1. **MCP Tool Usage Workflow**:
   ```
   1. Analyze user's architecture description
   2. Identify required AWS services and configurations
   3. Use get_pricing_service_attributes() to understand available filters
   4. Use get_pricing_attribute_values() to get valid filter values
   5. Call get_pricing() with optimized filters for each service
   6. Calculate total costs and provide breakdown
   7. Identify optimization opportunities
   8. Present results in structured format
   ```

2. **Optimized Filter Patterns**:
   - **EC2**: instanceType, tenancy, operatingSystem, location
   - **RDS**: instanceType, engineCode, deploymentOption
   - **S3**: storageClass, volumeType
   - **Lambda**: memorySize, architecture

3. **Performance Guidelines**:
   - Use specific filters to reduce response size
   - Batch queries with ANY_OF filters
   - Use multi-region queries for comparisons
   - Cache results within conversations

### Caching Implementation

```python
# Simple but effective caching system
query_hash = hash(query.lower().strip())
if query_hash in self.query_cache:
    self.performance_stats['cache_hits'] += 1
    return cached_response
```

### Performance Tracking

```python
performance_stats = {
    'total_queries': 0,
    'cache_hits': 0,
    'mcp_calls': 0,
    'avg_response_time': 0
}
```
